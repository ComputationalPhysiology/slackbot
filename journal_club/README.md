# Journal club

Here we will store the files for listing relevant papers for the
journal club.

Relevant papers should be added to the journal_club.bib file.
We could also make python API using e.g
[bibtextparser](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io) in order to make
the bot show the relevant papers.
